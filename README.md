## Video

10.000.000 million particles in a square domain. Central particles get a high initial velocity and crash into the rest of the material. (Domain is rotated by 90Â°)

## Download
    git clone https://github.com/hausler89/gas2017.git
    
## Description
Simple n-body simulation of particles with Lennard-Jones repulsion between them.
North and South wall are periodic, east and west are LJ repulsive.

Main source file is gas.cpp, there you will find the definition of global variables, system parameters and the main function. The verlet integrator is directly implemented in main(), as this is the main purpose of this program anyways.
